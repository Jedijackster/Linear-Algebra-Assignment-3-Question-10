Below is the question presented in assignment 3 of Professor Dillhoffs CSE-3380-002 of Fall 2024

10. Given the matrix A and vector b, complete the following problems in Python.
Clearly comment in your code which statements belong to which problem. Your
submission will include the code file used to answer the problems. Saved your code
as assignment3.py.
A = [ 4  8  −5]
    [ −3 −6 −7]
    [ 2  4   2]
b = [ −1]
    [ −1]
    [  3]
(a) Compute the reduced echelon form of A and convert the result back to a numpy
array. You will need sympy to compute the reduced echelon form.
(b) Find the column space of A.
(c) Solve the matrix equation Ax = b.
(d) Compute Nul A.
